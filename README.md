**A Deep Q-Learning AI for the Blokjes Game**

![Project Logo](path/to/logo.png)

## Overview

Blokjes is a Python-based implementation of the [Blokes](https://frozenfractal.com/games/blokjes/) and a Dueling Deep Q-Learning (DQN) AI agent with prioritized replay coded from scratch in numpy. The project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to develop an intelligent agent capable of learning optimal strategies through self-play.

## Features

- Customizable 5x5 game grid.
- AI agent powered by Deep Q-Learning.
- Comprehensive training environment for reinforcement learning experiments.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheMerjin/Blocks-Blokjes.git
   cd Blocks-Blokjes
2. **Install numpy using pip**
   ```bash
