# Blocks-Blokjes
A enviornment coded of a game called blokjes (https://blokjes.frozenfractal.com/)  and a deep- Q learning network trained from experience replay. The network is functional and I will train it soon over probably 300,000 episodes if possible. The board is a 5 by 5 grid and the board state is represented to a (1, 74) matrix 25 for the baord itself with 0's and 1 representing the color of each square, a onehot encoded representation for the held piece and 3 one hot encoded representation for the next pieces.
